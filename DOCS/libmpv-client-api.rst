Client API (libmpv) documentation and examples
==============================================

libmpv lets you embed mpv as a library. It is meant to enable development of
GUI frontends.

Since libmpv merely allows access to underlying mechanisms that can control
mpv, documentation is spread over a few places:

- https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/libmpv/client.h
- http://mpv.io/manual/master/#options
- http://mpv.io/manual/master/#list-of-input-commands
- http://mpv.io/manual/master/#properties
- https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-examples/tree/master/libmpv
