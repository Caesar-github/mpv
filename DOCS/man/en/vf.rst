VIDEO FILTERS
=============

Video filters allow you to modify the video stream and its properties. The
syntax is:

``--vf=<filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...>``
    Setup a chain of video filters.

Many parameters are optional and set to default values if omitted. To
explicitly use a default value, set a parameter to '-1'. Parameters ``w:h``
means width x height in pixels, ``x:y`` means x;y position counted from the
upper left corner of the bigger image.

.. note::

    To get a full list of available video filters, see ``--vf=help``.

Video filters are managed in lists. There are a few commands to manage the
filter list.

``--vf-add=<filter1[,filter2,...]>``
    Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

``--vf-pre=<filter1[,filter2,...]>``
    Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

``--vf-del=<index1[,index2,...]>``
    Deletes the filters at the given indexes. Index numbers start at 0,
    negative numbers address the end of the list (-1 is the last).

``--vf-clr``
    Completely empties the filter list.

With filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

``--vf=<filter>=help``
    Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a particular
    filter.

``--vf=<filter=named_parameter1=value1[:named_parameter2=value2:...]>``
    Sets a named parameter to the given value. Use on and off or yes and no to
    set flag parameters.

Available filters are:

``crop[=w:h:x:y]``
    Crops the given part of the image and discards the rest. Useful to remove
    black bands from widescreen movies.

    ``<w>,<h>``
        Cropped width and height, defaults to original width and height.
    ``<x>,<y>``
        Position of the cropped picture, defaults to center.

``expand[=w:h:x:y:aspect:round]``
    Expands (not scales) movie resolution to the given value and places the
    unscaled original at coordinates x, y.

    ``<w>,<h>``
        Expanded width,height (default: original width,height). Negative
        values for w and h are treated as offsets to the original size.

        .. admonition:: Example

            ``expand=0:-50:0:0``
                Adds a 50 pixel border to the bottom of the picture.

    ``<x>,<y>``
        position of original image on the expanded image (default: center)

    ``<aspect>``
        Expands to fit an aspect instead of a resolution (default: 0).

        .. admonition:: Example

            ``expand=800:::::4/3``
                Expands to 800x600, unless the source is higher resolution, in
                which case it expands to fill a 4/3 aspect.

    ``<round>``
        Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by <r> (default: 1).

``flip``
    Flips the image upside down. See also ``--flip``.

``mirror``
    Mirrors the image on the Y axis.

``rotate[=<0-7>]``
    Rotates the image by 90 degrees and optionally flips it. For values
    between 4-7 rotation is only done if the movie geometry is portrait and
    not landscape.

    :0: Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip (default).
    :1: Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.
    :2: Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.
    :3: Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and flip.

``scale[=w:h[:interlaced[:chr_drop[:par[:par2[:noup[:arnd]]]]]]]``
    Scales the image with the software scaler (slow) and performs a YUV<->RGB
    colorspace conversion (see also ``--sws``).

    ``<w>,<h>``
        scaled width/height (default: original width/height)

        :0:      scaled d_width/d_height
        :-1:     original width/height
        :-2:     Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the prescaled
                 aspect ratio.
        :-3:     Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the original
                 aspect ratio.
        :-(n+8): Like -n above, but rounding the dimension to the closest
                 multiple of 16.

    ``<chr_drop>``
        chroma skipping

        :0: Use all available input lines for chroma.
        :1: Use only every 2. input line for chroma.
        :2: Use only every 4. input line for chroma.
        :3: Use only every 8. input line for chroma.

    ``<par>[:<par2>]`` (see also ``--sws``)
        Set some scaling parameters depending on the type of scaler selected
        with ``--sws``::

            --sws=2 (bicubic):  B (blurring) and C (ringing)
                0.00:0.60 default
                0.00:0.75 VirtualDub's "precise bicubic"
                0.00:0.50 Catmull-Rom spline
                0.33:0.33 Mitchell-Netravali spline
                1.00:0.00 cubic B-spline

            --sws=7 (gaussian): sharpness (0 (soft) - 100 (sharp))

            --sws=9 (lanczos):  filter length (1-10)

    ``<noup>``
        Disallow upscaling past the original dimensions.

        :0: Allow upscaling (default).
        :1: Disallow upscaling if one dimension exceeds its original value.
        :2: Disallow upscaling if both dimensions exceed their original values.

    ``<arnd>``
        Accurate rounding for the vertical scaler, which may be faster or
        slower than the default rounding.

        :0: Disable accurate rounding (default).
        :1: Enable accurate rounding.

``dsize[=aspect|w:h:aspect-method:r]``
    Changes the intended display size/aspect at an arbitrary point in the
    filter chain. Aspect can be given as a fraction (4/3) or floating point
    number (1.33). Alternatively, you may specify the exact display width and
    height desired. Note that this filter does *not* do any scaling itself; it
    just affects what later scalers (software or hardware) will do when
    auto-scaling to correct aspect.

    ``<w>,<h>``
        New display width and height.

        Can also be these special values:

        :0:  original display width and height
        :-1: original video width and height (default)
        :-2: Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the original display
             aspect ratio.
        :-3: Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the original video
             aspect ratio.

        .. admonition:: Example

            ``dsize=800:-2``
                Specifies a display resolution of 800x600 for a 4/3 aspect
                video, or 800x450 for a 16/9 aspect video.

    ``<aspect-method>``
        Modifies width and height according to original aspect ratios.

        :-1: Ignore original aspect ratio (default).
        :0:  Keep display aspect ratio by using ``<w>`` and ``<h>`` as maximum
             resolution.
        :1:  Keep display aspect ratio by using ``<w>`` and ``<h>`` as minimum
             resolution.
        :2:  Keep video aspect ratio by using ``<w>`` and ``<h>`` as maximum
             resolution.
        :3:  Keep video aspect ratio by using ``<w>`` and ``<h>`` as minimum
             resolution.

        .. admonition:: Example

            ``dsize=800:600:0``
                Specifies a display resolution of at most 800x600, or smaller,
                in order to keep aspect.

    ``<r>``
        Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by ``<r>``
        (default: 1).

``format[=fmt[:outfmt]]``
    Restricts the color space for the next filter without doing any conversion.
    Use together with the scale filter for a real conversion.

    .. note::

        For a list of available formats, see ``format=fmt=help``.

    ``<fmt>``
        Format name, e.g. rgb15, bgr24, 420p, etc. (default: yuyv).
    ``<outfmt>``
        Format name that should be substituted for the output. If this is not
        100% compatible with the ``<fmt>`` value, it will crash.

        .. admonition:: Examples

            ====================== =====================
            Valid                  Invalid (will crash)
            ====================== =====================
            ``format=rgb24:bgr24`` ``format=rgb24:420p``
            ``format=yuyv:uyvy``
            ====================== =====================

``noformat[=fmt]``
    Restricts the colorspace for the next filter without doing any conversion.
    Unlike the format filter, this will allow any colorspace except the one
    you specify.

    .. note:: For a list of available formats, see ``noformat=fmt=help``.

    ``<fmt>``
        Format name, e.g. rgb15, bgr24, 420p, etc. (default: 420p).

``pp[=filter1[:option1[:option2...]]/[-]filter2...]``
    Enables the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters. Subfilters must
    be separated by '/' and can be disabled by prepending a '-'. Each
    subfilter and some options have a short and a long name that can be used
    interchangeably, i.e. ``dr``/``dering`` are the same. All subfilters share
    common options to determine their scope:

    ``a/autoq``
        Automatically switch the subfilter off if the CPU is too slow.
    ``c/chrom``
        Do chrominance filtering, too (default).
    ``y/nochrom``
        Do luminance filtering only (no chrominance).
    ``n/noluma``
        Do chrominance filtering only (no luminance).

    .. note::

        ``--pphelp`` shows a list of available subfilters.

    Available subfilters are:

    ``hb/hdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]``
        horizontal deblocking filter

        :<difference>: Difference factor where higher values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 32).
        :<flatness>:   Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 39).

    ``vb/vdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]``
        vertical deblocking filter

        :<difference>: Difference factor where higher values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 32).
        :<flatness>:   Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 39).

    ``ha/hadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]``
        accurate horizontal deblocking filter

        :<difference>: Difference factor where higher values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 32).
        :<flatness>:   Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 39).

    ``va/vadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]``
        accurate vertical deblocking filter

        :<difference>: Difference factor where higher values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 32).
        :<flatness>:   Flatness threshold where lower values mean more
                       deblocking (default: 39).

    The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share the difference and
    flatness values so you cannot set different horizontal and vertical
    thresholds.

        experimental horizontal deblocking filter

    ``v1/x1vdeblock``
        experimental vertical deblocking filter

    ``ac``
        high quality pp filter combination (ha:a:128:7,va:a,dr:a)

    .. note::

        This filter is only available if FFmpeg/libav has been compiled
        with libpostproc enabled.

    .. admonition:: Examples

        ``--vf=pp=hb/vb/dr/al``
            horizontal and vertical deblocking, deringing and automatic
            brightness/contrast

        ``--vf=pp=de/-al``
            default filters without brightness/contrast correction

        ``--vf=pp=default/tmpnoise:1:2:3``
            Enable default filters & temporal denoiser.

        ``--vf=pp=hb:y/vb:a``
            Horizontal deblocking on luminance only, and switch vertical
            deblocking on or off automatically depending on available CPU time.

``lavfi=graph[:sws_flags[:o=opts]]``
    Filter video using FFmpeg's libavfilter.

    ``<graph>``
        The libavfilter graph string. The filter must have a single video input
        pad and a single video output pad.

        See `<https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html>`_ for syntax and available
        filters.

        .. warning::

            If you want to use the full filter syntax with this option, you have
            to quote the filter graph in order to prevent mpv's syntax and the
            filter graph syntax from clashing.

        .. admonition:: Examples

            ``-vf lavfi=[gradfun=20:30,vflip]``
                ``gradfun`` filter with nonsense parameters, followed by a
                ``vflip`` filter. (This demonstrates how libavfilter takes a
                graph and not just a single filter.) The filter graph string is
                quoted with ``[`` and ``]``. This requires no additional quoting
                or escaping with some shells (like bash), while others (like
                zsh) require additional ``"`` quotes around the option string.

            ``'--vf=lavfi="gradfun=20:30,vflip"'``
                Same as before, but uses quoting that should be safe with all
                shells. The outer ``'`` quotes make sure that the shell does not
                remove the ``"`` quotes needed by mpv.

            ``'--vf=lavfi=graph="gradfun=radius=30:strength=20,vflip"'``
                Same as before, but uses named parameters for everything.

    ``<sws_flags>``
        If libavfilter inserts filters for pixel format conversion, this
        option gives the flags which should be passed to libswscale. This
        option is numeric and takes a bit-wise combination of ``SWS_`` flags.

        See ``http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=libswscale/swscale.h``.

    ``<o>``
        Set AVFilterGraph options. These should be documented by FFmpeg.

        .. admonition:: Example

            ``'--vf=lavfi=yadif:o="threads=2,thread_type=slice"'``
                forces a specific threading configuration.

``noise[=luma[u][t|a][h][p]:chroma[u][t|a][h][p]]``
    Adds noise.

    :<0-100>: luma noise
    :<0-100>: chroma noise
    :u:       uniform noise (gaussian otherwise)
    :t:       temporal noise (noise pattern changes between frames)
    :a:       averaged temporal noise (smoother, but a lot slower)
    :h:       high quality (slightly better looking, slightly slower)
    :p:       mix random noise with a (semi)regular pattern

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``noise`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

``hqdn3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]``
    This filter aims to reduce image noise producing smooth images and making
    still images really still (This should enhance compressibility.).

    ``<luma_spatial>``
        spatial luma strength (default: 4)
    ``<chroma_spatial>``
        spatial chroma strength (default: 3)
    ``<luma_tmp>``
        luma temporal strength (default: 6)
    ``<chroma_tmp>``
        chroma temporal strength (default:
        ``luma_tmp*chroma_spatial/luma_spatial``)

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``hqdn3d`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

``eq[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]``
    Software equalizer that uses lookup tables (slow), allowing gamma correction
    in addition to simple brightness and contrast adjustment. The parameters are
    given as floating point values.

    ``<0.1-10>``
        initial gamma value (default: 1.0)
    ``<-2-2>``
        initial contrast, where negative values result in a negative image
        (default: 1.0)
    ``<-1-1>``
        initial brightness (default: 0.0)
    ``<0-3>``
        initial saturation (default: 1.0)
    ``<0.1-10>``
        gamma value for the red component (default: 1.0)
    ``<0.1-10>``
        gamma value for the green component (default: 1.0)
    ``<0.1-10>``
        gamma value for the blue component (default: 1.0)
    ``<0-1>``
        The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of a high gamma
        value on bright image areas, e.g. keep them from getting overamplified
        and just plain white. A value of 0.0 turns the gamma correction all
        the way down while 1.0 leaves it at its full strength (default: 1.0).

``ilpack[=mode]``
    When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma interlacing
    does not line up properly due to vertical downsampling of the chroma
    channels. This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data into YUY2 (4:2:2) format
    with the chroma lines in their proper locations, so that in any given
    scanline, the luma and chroma data both come from the same field.

    ``<mode>``
        Select the sampling mode.

        :0: nearest-neighbor sampling, fast but incorrect
        :1: linear interpolation (default)

``unsharp[=l|cWxH:amount[:l|cWxH:amount]]``
    unsharp mask / gaussian blur

    ``l``
        Apply effect on luma component.

    ``c``
        Apply effect on chroma components.

    ``<width>x<height>``
        width and height of the matrix, odd sized in both directions (min =
        3x3, max = 13x11 or 11x13, usually something between 3x3 and 7x7)

    ``amount``
        Relative amount of sharpness/blur to add to the image (a sane range
        should be -1.5-1.5).

        :<0: blur
        :>0: sharpen

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``unsharp`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

``swapuv``
    Swap U & V plane.

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``swapuv`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

``pullup[=jl:jr:jt:jb:sb:mp]``
    Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
    hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
    content. The ``pullup`` filter makes use of future context in making its
    decisions. It is stateless in the sense that it does not lock onto a pattern
    to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following fields in order to
    identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

    ``jl``, ``jr``, ``jt``, and ``jb``
        These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right,
        top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left/right are in units of
        8 pixels, while top/bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8
        pixels on each side.

    ``sb`` (strict breaks)
        Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of ``pullup``
        generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
        excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
        Conversely, setting it to -1 will make ``pullup`` match fields more
        easily. This may help processing of video where there is slight
        blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced
        frames in the output.

    ``mp`` (metric plane)
        This option may be set to 1 or 2 to use a chroma plane instead of the
        luma plane for doing ``pullup``'s computations. This may improve accuracy
        on very clean source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy,
        especially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale
        video. The main purpose of setting ``mp`` to a chroma plane is to reduce
        CPU load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

``divtc[=options]``
    Inverse telecine for deinterlaced video. If 3:2-pulldown telecined video
    has lost one of the fields or is deinterlaced using a method that keeps
    one field and interpolates the other, the result is a juddering video that
    has every fourth frame duplicated. This filter is intended to find and
    drop those duplicates and restore the original film framerate. Two
    different modes are available: One-pass mode is the default and is
    straightforward to use, but has the disadvantage that any changes in the
    telecine phase (lost frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder until the
    filter can resync again. Two-pass mode avoids this by analyzing the entire
    video beforehand so it will have forward knowledge about the phase changes
    and can resync at the exact spot. These passes do *not* correspond to pass
    one and two of the encoding process. You must run an extra pass using
    ``divtc`` pass one before the actual encoding throwing the resulting video
    away. Then use ``divtc`` pass two for the actual encoding. If you use
    multiple encoder passes, use ``divtc`` pass two for all of them.

    The options are:

    ``pass=1|2``
        Use two pass mode.

    ``file=<filename>``
        Set the two pass log filename (default: ``framediff.log``).

    ``threshold=<value>``
        Set the minimum strength the telecine pattern must have for the filter
        to believe in it (default: 0.5). This is used to avoid recognizing
        false pattern from the parts of the video that are very dark or very
        still.

    ``window=<numframes>``
        Set the number of past frames to look at when searching for pattern
        (default: 30). Longer window improves the reliability of the pattern
        search, but shorter window improves the reaction time to the changes
        in the telecine phase. This only affects the one-pass mode. The
        two-pass mode currently uses fixed window that extends to both future
        and past.

    ``phase=0|1|2|3|4``
        Sets the initial telecine phase for one pass mode (default: 0). The
        two-pass mode can see the future, so it is able to use the correct
        phase from the beginning, but one-pass mode can only guess. It catches
        the correct phase when it finds it, but this option can be used to fix
        the possible juddering at the beginning. The first pass of the two
        pass mode also uses this, so if you save the output from the first
        pass, you get constant phase result.

    ``deghost=<value>``
        Set the deghosting threshold (0-255 for one-pass mode, -255-255 for
        two-pass mode, default 0). If nonzero, deghosting mode is used. This
        is for video that has been deinterlaced by blending the fields
        together instead of dropping one of the fields. Deghosting amplifies
        any compression artifacts in the blended frames, so the parameter
        value is used as a threshold to exclude those pixels from deghosting
        that differ from the previous frame less than specified value. If two
        pass mode is used, then negative value can be used to make the filter
        analyze the whole video in the beginning of pass-2 to determine
        whether it needs deghosting or not and then select either zero or the
        absolute value of the parameter. Specify this option for pass 2, it
        makes no difference on pass 1.

``phase[=t|b|p|a|u|T|B|A|U][:v]``
    Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order changes.
    The intended use is to fix PAL movies that have been captured with the
    opposite field order to the film-to-video transfer. The options are:

    ``t``
        Capture field order top-first, transfer bottom-first. Filter will
        delay the bottom field.

    ``b``
        Capture bottom-first, transfer top-first. Filter will delay the top
        field.

    ``p``
        Capture and transfer with the same field order. This mode only exists
        for the documentation of the other options to refer to, but if you
        actually select it, the filter will faithfully do nothing ;-)

    ``a``
        Capture field order determined automatically by field flags, transfer
        opposite. Filter selects among ``t`` and ``b`` modes on a frame by frame
        basis using field flags. If no field information is available, then this
        works just like ``u``.

    ``u``
        Capture unknown or varying, transfer opposite. Filter selects among
        ``t`` and ``b`` on a frame by frame basis by analyzing the images and
        selecting the alternative that produces best match between the fields.

    ``T``
        Capture top-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among
        ``t`` and ``p`` using image analysis.

    ``B``
        Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects
        among ``b`` and ``p`` using image analysis.

    ``A``
        Capture determined by field flags, transfer unknown or varying. Filter
        selects among ``t``, ``b`` and ``p`` using field flags and image
        analysis. If no field information is available, then this works just
        like ``U``. This is the default mode.

    ``U``
        Both capture and transfer unknown or varying. Filter selects among
        ``t``, ``b`` and ``p`` using image analysis only.

    ``v``
        Verbose operation. Prints the selected mode for each frame and the
        average squared difference between fields for ``t``, ``b``, and ``p``
        alternatives.

``yadif=[mode[:enabled=yes|no]]``
    Yet another deinterlacing filter

    ``<mode>``
        :0: Output 1 frame for each frame.
        :1: Output 1 frame for each field.
        :2: Like 0 but skips spatial interlacing check.
        :3: Like 1 but skips spatial interlacing check.

    ``<enabled>``
        :yes: Filter is active (default).
        :no:  Filter is not active, but can be activated with the ``D`` key
              (or any other key that toggles the ``deinterlace`` property).

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``yadif`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

    This filter, or libavfilter's implementation if available, is automatically
    inserted when using the ``D`` key (or any other key that toggles the
    ``deinterlace`` property), assuming the video output does not have native
    deinterlacing support.

``down3dright[=lines]``
    Reposition and resize stereoscopic images. Extracts both stereo fields and
    places them side by side, resizing them to maintain the original movie
    aspect.

    ``<lines>``
        number of lines to select from the middle of the image (default: 12)

``delogo[=x:y:w:h:t]``
    Suppresses a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the surrounding
    pixels. Just set a rectangle covering the logo and watch it disappear (and
    sometimes something even uglier appear - your mileage may vary).

    ``<x>,<y>``
        top left corner of the logo
    ``<w>,<h>``
        width and height of the cleared rectangle
    ``<t>``
        Thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to ``w`` and
        ``h``). When set to -1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to
        simplify finding the right ``x``,``y``,``w``,``h`` parameters.
    ``file=<file>``
        You can specify a text file to load the coordinates from.  Each line
        must have a timestamp (in seconds, and in ascending order) and the
        ``x:y:w:h:t`` coordinates (``t`` can be omitted).

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``delogo`` or ``removelogo`` filters
        through ``--vf=lavfi`` instead.

``screenshot``
    Optional filter for screenshot support. This is only needed if the video
    output does not provide working direct screenshot support. Note that it is
    not always safe to insert this filter by default. See `TAKING SCREENSHOTS`_
    for details.

``sub=[=bottom-margin:top-margin]``
    Moves subtitle rendering to an arbitrary point in the filter chain, or force
    subtitle rendering in the video filter as opposed to using video output OSD
    support.

    ``<bottom-margin>``
        Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame. The SSA/ASS renderer can
        place subtitles there (with ``--ass-use-margins``).
    ``<top-margin>``
        Black band on the top for toptitles  (with ``--ass-use-margins``).

    .. admonition:: Examples

        ``--vf=sub,eq``
            Moves sub rendering before the eq filter. This will put both
            subtitle colors and video under the influence of the video equalizer
            settings.

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``stereo3d`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

``gradfun[=strength[:radius]]``
    Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
    regions by truncation to 8bit color depth. Interpolates the gradients that
    should go where the bands are, and dithers them.

    ``<strength>``

        threshold for detecting nearly flat regions (default: 1.2).

    ``<radius>``
        Neighborhood to fit the gradient to. Larger radius makes for smoother
        gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying pixels near
        detailed regions (default: 16).

    .. note::

        Deprecated. Use libavfilter's ``gradfun`` filter through ``--vf=lavfi``
        instead.

``dlopen=dll[:a0[:a1[:a2[:a3]]]]``
    Loads an external library to filter the image. The library interface
    is the ``vf_dlopen`` interface specified using ``libmpcodecs/vf_dlopen.h``.

    ``dll=<library>``
        Specify the library to load. This may require a full file system path
        in some cases. This argument is required.

    ``a0=<string>``
        Specify the first parameter to pass to the library.

    ``a1=<string>``
        Specify the second parameter to pass to the library.

    ``a2=<string>``
        Specify the third parameter to pass to the library.

    ``a3=<string>``
        Specify the fourth parameter to pass to the library.

``vavpp``
    VA-AP-API video post processing. Works with ``--vo=vaapi`` and ``--vo=opengl``
    only. Currently deinterlaces. This filter is automatically inserted if
    deinterlacing is requested (either using the ``D`` key, by default mapped to
    the command ``cycle deinterlace``, or the ``--deinterlace`` option).

    ``deint=<method>``
        Select the deinterlacing algorithm.

        no
            Don't perform deinterlacing.
        first-field
            Show only first field (going by ``--field-dominance``).
        bob
            bob deinterlacing (default).
