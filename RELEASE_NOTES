Release 0.7.2
=============

Changes
-------

- Give precedence to the DVD menu navigation keyboard bindings so that user
  defined LEFT/RIGHT/... bindings don't break DVD menu navigation.
- Try to fallback to the "default" device if the selected device is busy in the
  alsa AO.
- Don't create Dock icon for audio only files on OS X.
- Save screenshots to desktop when using the app bundle on OS X.
- Restore ab-loop settings with playback resume.
- Bump required youtube-dl version to 2014.11.26 and enable the ytdl_hook Lua
  script by default (now playing videos from YouTube and the like will work
  out of the box without any configuration change needed).

Bug fixes
---------

- Don't signal an error if --stream-dump is used.
- Fix removing key bindings from Lua scripts.
- Reject channel descriptions with too many channels in the coreaudio AO.
- Don't async redraw when waiting for VO redraw on OS X (this fixes the very
  annoying glitch where the black bars disappear for a single frame when going
  fullscreen).
- Fix mono playback with the also AO.
- Don't crash if framebuffers are not available in the opengl VO.

New features
------------

- Try to handle multi-arc videos in the ytdl_hook Lua script.

Release 0.7.1
=============

Changes
-------

- Don't show the volume neutral marker on the OSD if softvol is disabled.
- Don't select a subtitle track when executing the sub_add input command in
  "auto" mode.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix busy loop when seeking while paused (this fixes a problem with pulseaudio
  that caused mpv and the pulseaudio daemon to use 100% CPU).
- Fix Lua function utils.subprocess() in Windows versions older than Vista.
- Avoid creating a window bigger than the screen on Windows.
- Don't ignore the last line in m3u playlists.
- Don't crash if a codec could not be opened.
- Dynamically allocate audio channel map entries (this should fix a crash in
  the alsa and coreaudio AOs with audio devices that support more than 20
  channel maps).
- Ignore the "srgb" option in the opengl VO if hardware decoding is enabled.
- Linearize non-RGB sRGB files correctly (eg. JPEG).
- Fix opening reference URLs (.file/id=) on OS X.

Release 0.7.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Buffer partial log messages in the client API (the client API will now only
  pass full log messages to clients).
- Remove ncurses/terminfo/termcap support (it was disabled by default and
  replaced by new code since v0.6.0).
- Enable cdda:// support by default again (it was disabled since v0.6.0).
- Cascade-load input.conf (if there are several input.confs in the set of valid
  config paths, load them all).
- Draw the OSD twice in 3D mode (this fixes subtitles display in 3D mode).
- Make wasapi the default AO on Windows again since many of its problems have
  been solved.
- Use "site-functions" subdir to install the zsh completion script instead of
  the Debian-specific "vendor-completions" (also provide the --zshdir waf
  configure option for changing this value).
- Improve synchronization between the Cocoa GUI and the player (this fixes some
  long standing deadlock issues on Mac OS X).
- Remove --fs-missioncontrol option (only relevant to Mac OS X).

New features
------------

- Enable pitch correction by default when playing at higher speeds (this can be
  controlled with the --audio-pitch-correction option).
- Open stream and demuxer asynchronously (this should avoid having the player
  get blocked on network streams).
- Add cache-buffering-state property for querying the cache fill status until
  the player unpauses.
- Add support for listing and selecting the audio device (note that it is not
  implemented for all AOs, see the --audio-device option for more information).
- Add support for a JSON-based IPC mechanism (note that this is not currently
  supported on Windows, see the JSON IPC section in the manpage for more
  information).
- Add Lua utility function for starting processes (see utils.subprocess() in the
  manpage).
- Add Lua utility function for parsing JSON (see utils.parse_json() in the
  manpage).
- Add field-dominance property (see --field-dominance option).
- Add video-rotate property (see --video-rotate option).
- Add playback-abort property for querying whether playback is stopped or is to
  be stopped.
- Add cursor-autohide property (see --cursor-autohide option).
- Add vo-configured property for querying whether a window is created.
- Add support for dxva2 hardware acceleration on Windows.
- Drop libquvi support (this has been replaced by a built-in Lua script that
  invokes the youtube-dl tool, which needs to be installed, see the --ytdl
  option).
- Add support for loading chapters from an external file (see the
  --chapters-file option).
- Add window-minimized property for querying whether the window is minimized
  (works for X11 only).
- Make it possible to configure the OSC seekbar style (see the "seekbarstyle"
  OSC option).
- Add support for libmpv on Mac OS X (it used to be broken, now it's fully
  functional and also provides support for embedding the mpv window inside a
  Cocoa/Qt application).
- Try to use the audio channel map reported by ALSA in the alsa AO.
- Add option to disable text OSD rendering completely (useful for working around
  certain fontconfig issues, see the --use-text-osd option).
