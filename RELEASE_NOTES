Release 0.8.0
=============

Changes
-------

Changes that may break users' config files have been annotated with a `(!)`.

- `(!)` vo_opengl_old has been removed. OpenGL rendering now requires hardware
  that can do at least OpenGL 2.1, the oldest version supported by vo_opengl.
- `(!)` vf_pp has been removed. A version of it can still be accessed through
  lavfilter (e.g. --vf=lavfi=[pp...]), but it receives no QP information.
  Also, vf_dlopen no longer passes QP information to its loaded plugin either
  (it's always 0).
- `(!)` vf_softpulldown, vf_swapuv, vf_phase, vf_divtc and vf_ilpack have all
  been removed. Ports or alternative versions of these filters are available
  through libavfilter (vf_lavfi).
- vf_pullup and vf_noise now are simply wrappers to their libavfilter
  equivalents. Both are only currently available on FFmpeg (not Libav).
- `(!)` ao_portaudio has been removed. There is good support for the native
  audio drivers of all major desktop platforms, as well as ao_sdl and
  ao_openal as fallbacks.
- `(!)` vo_opengl's `lscale` suboption has been renamed to `scale`; `lradius`
  is now `scale-radius`, `lparam1` and `lparam2` are now respectively
  `scale-param1` and `scale-param2`; `lscale-down` is now `scale-down`.
  The `cscale` suboption remains as is.
- `(!)` Several of the `vo_opengl` radius-preset aliases supported by `scale`
  have been removed; use `scale-radius` to set if needed. For example, use
  `--vo=opengl:scale=lanczos:scale-radius=2` instead of `scale=lanczos2`.
  The default radius is recommended for most filters.
- `(!)` vo_opengl no longer supports the `stereo` suboption. The anaglyph
  effect can be reproduced with the stereo3d filter. The quadbuffer support,
  which requires expensive specialized hardware to begin with, is removed.
- `(!)` The `approx-gamma` suboption to vo_opengl has been removed. The
  BT.1886 specification says that it's actually how it's supposed to be done
  so it is now the default when `srgb` or `icc-profile` are enabled. This does
  not include BT.1886's gamma drop.
- `(!)` The `no-scale-sep` and `indirect` suboptions to vo_opengl have been
  removed. These are now autodetected and enabled whenever they would have
  benefit.
- `(!)` The `--lua` and `--lua-opts` parameters / options are now called
  `--script` and `--script-opts`, respectively. The `lua` subdir of the mpv
  config dir is also now expected to be called `scripts` instead.
- `(!)` The `--fixed-vo` option has been removed. It has been the default for
  a long time anyway, and disabling fixed-vo is not useful.
- vo_opengl_hq has been updated to take into account new features.
  `fancy-downscaling` and `sigmoid-upscaling` are enabled,
  "mitchell" is now the default for `scale-down`.
- The `sub-visibility` OSD message is now clearer about whether subtitles
  are hidden or just not available / selected.
- The device IDs given to `--audio-device` for use with ao_coreaudio now use
  UIDs, so they don't change when devices are added/removed or after reboots.
- `--msg-level` now also accepts ',' as separator.
- (Client API) The client API now refuses to initialize if the LC_NUMERIC
  locale is not "C".
- (Client API) The native type of the `msg-level` parameter is now a key-value
  list. Setting or reading it as a string still works.
- (Slave API) The `get_property` command is now deprecated.
- Documentation updates.
- PDF documentation is now disabled by default due to rst2pdf being fickle,
  causing weird build errors.
- Print desync messages with negative A/V sync as well. While rare, it could
  happen with some uses of `--autosync`.

Bug fixes
---------

- (Windows) Avoid resizing the video window when player is minimized, might
  address bug #1547.
- (NetBSD) Fix build with v4l2.
- (Linux) Attempt to address conflicts with the pulseaudio mixer. (bug #1578)
- Multiple cdda:// fixes. (bugs #1555, #1560)
- VP9 timestamps no longer cause "missing PTS" warnings with new enough FFmpeg
  builds.
- Fix a crash when using H.264 hardware decoding on new enough libavcodecs.
  (bug #1587)

New features
------------

- vo_opengl now supports frame blending to eliminate stuttering when the video
  framerate does not nicely match the display framerate through the
  `smoothmotion` suboption. This is not meant to artificially increase the
  video's FPS, so there is no "soap opera effect" or difficulties with some
  video types (e.g. anime).
- vo_opengl now supports sigmoidal upscaling (e.g. for fullscreen), which
  reduces ringing induced by upscaling, enabled through the
  `sigmoid-upscaling` suboption.
- vo_opengl now supports ewa_lanczos (Jinc) scaling, which provides higher
  quality with less aliasing. It supports an experimental `scale-antiringing`
  parameter, which tries to further reduce video ringing.
- vo_opengl now has a `linear-scaling` suboption, that makes the scalers work
  in linear light. Implied by the `srgb`, `icc-profile` or the new
  `sigmoid-upscaling` suboption.
- vo_opengl has improved downscaling for higher downscale ratios when
  `fancy-downscaling` is enabled.
- Add `--keep-open=always` to make `--keep-open` apply to all files instead of
  only the last.
- mpv now filters the tags that are printed on the console to try to hide
  useless metadata. The filter works as a whitelist, and can be configured
  with the `--display-tags` option.
- Add a `--sub-scale-by-window` option that, when set to 'no', prevents
  subtitles from changing their pixel size when the window changes sizes.
- vo_opengl now technically has GLES 2 and 3 support (but not GLES 1). GLES 3
  support is only tested on Mesa's software emulation. GLES 2 has been tested
  on nvidia drivers. Both GLES modes are feature deficient and inefficient due
  to GLES limitations, so they should not be preferred over the standard
  OpenGL mode.
- (X11) vo_opengl now supports the `icc-profile-auto` option on X11 hosts.
- The 'A' key now by default cycles through a list of preset aspect ratios.
  Meant to be used to work around broken files.
- There is now a "force" mode for `--loop`. Works like "inf", but tries to
  open files/streams even if there was an error on the previous attempt.
- There is now a `--log-file` option to write mpv's log messages to a specifed
  file.
- There is now a `--audio-file-auto` option to automatically load an external
  audio file with certain constraints. Will only load external audio if the
  playing file has a video stream. Set to "exact" by default. (bug #967)
- There is now a `--network-timeout` option to specify a timeout in seconds
  for network access. If 0 (default), uses the libavformat default. If a
  protocol that doesn't support timeouts is used, this option is ignored.
- (X11) The XF86 special keys are now all mappable in `input.conf`. All keys
  documented in `XF86keysym.h` are available, but only as their numeric codes.
- (Linux) The DVB implementation now supports DVB-S2 through S2API.
- (Linux) The VDR format for `channels.conf` is now supported and preferred.
  See http://linuxtv.org/vdrwiki/index.php/Syntax_of_channels.conf for the
  syntax. Tuning to DVB-S2 channels requires the VDR-format `channels.conf`.
- (Linux) There is now a `--dvbin-full-transponder` option for handling
  special broadcast cases where PIDs switch, or just to work around incomplete
  PID data.
- (Client API) There is now an opengl_cb VO, which receives the OpenGL context
  from the libmpv client. This allows a client to render libmpv video directly
  to a provided OpenGL context without having to use --wid embedding.
- (Client API) The aforementioned --wid parameter can now be set at any time,
  but has no effect if a file is already loaded.
- (Client API) The list of DVD titles can now be queried.
- (Client API) There is now a `filtered-metadata` property, containing only
  the tags allowed by `--display-tags`.
- (Client API) There is now support for XEmbed `--wid` targets, such as a
  `GtkSocket`'s `gtk_socket_get_id()`.
- (Client API) There is now a `file-format` property with a symbolic name
  for the file format. In some cases this might be a comma separated list
  of various different extensions due to libavformat idiosyncrasies.
- (Client API) There is now a `mouse` command for generating mouse events
  over the video window.
- (Client API) There is now a `partially-seekable` property that indicates
  whether a file is only considered `seekable` because of the stream cache,
  but would not be seekable otherwise (e.g. realtime stream, or HTTP with
  no resume support). Small relative seeks may be fine, but larger seeks
  will likely fail.
- (Client API) There is now an MPV_EVENT_QUEUE_OVERFLOW event that is posted
  whenever events have to be dropped because the queue is full. No further
  events are posted until the MPV_EVENT_QUEUE_OVERFLOW is consumed to avoid
  duplicated posting.
- (Client API) There is now a helper `mpv_wait_async_requests()` function
  that blocks until all known async requests have completed. (bug #1542)
- (Client API) There is now a `detected-hwdec` property that returns the
  detected hardware decoder when one is successfully opened. This probably
  only returns a valid value after playback has started.
- (Client API) There are now `audio_add`, `audio_remove` and `audio_reload`
  counterparts to the equivalent `sub_` commands for handling external audio
  files.
