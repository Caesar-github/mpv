Changes
-------

- Build system switches to waf. The old build system is still available by
  running ``./old-configure``, but it will be removed some time in the future.
- The "run" input command changes in a not backwards compatible way.
- Some input.conf commands were replaced (such as speed_mult).
- Many audio/video filter have changed sub-options in a not backwards
  compatible way. (This is a consequence of unifying audio/video filter
  option parsing.)
- Most video filters now use libavfilter internally if available.
- Disable key autorepeat for some key binds, which prevents accidentally
  triggering a binding multiple times.
- Encoding: install and include encoding profiles by default.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix a bug that degraded vdpau playback after ~1 hour of runtime.
- Restrict hardware decoding to codecs where it generally makes sense. This
  excludes mpeg4 for example, which often causes hardware decoders to decode to
  garbage. Use ``--hwdec-codecs`` to enable hardware decoding for more codecs.

New features
------------

- Add window-scale property, which allows changing the window size via mpv key
  bindings.
- Add revert_seek command, which is meant to undo accidental seeks.
- Hardware decoding (vdpau, vda, vaapi) can now be used with vo_opengl.
- Pulseaudio: set pulse stream name to mpv window title (like MPlayer).
- Support showing 2 subtitles at a time (``--secondary-sid``).
- Re-add some basic ``dvdnav://`` support. This doesn't handle navigation
  highlights correctly, but navigation should mostly work. (Note that
  ``dvdnav://`` by default starts the longest title, instead of the DVD menu.
  The menu is available with ``dvdnav://menu``.)
- Win32: you can drop files on the mpv window.

This listing is not complete. There are many more bug fixes and changes. The
