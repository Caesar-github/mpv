Release 0.25.0
==============

This release drops support for OS X 10.7 and earlier.
Support for some optical media functionality (DVD/CD) is now disabled by default.

More parts of the player are now licensed under LGPL. In particular:

    * OSD symbol font
    * ass_mp, sd_ass
    * common.h
    * demux/packet
    * demux_mkv (with minor exceptions), ebml, matroska.h
    * sd_lavc
    * sub/osd

Thanks to all contributors who have agreed to relicensing of their changes!
See #2033 for details.

Starting with this release, releases will be tagged on the master branch.
The release/current branch is thus abandoned.

http://git.srsfckn.biz/mpv/log/?qt=range&q=v0.18.1..v0.19.0


Release 0.18.1
==============

Note: Running mpv with different versions of the FFmpeg/Libav libraries than
it was compiled with is no longer supported. Even supposedly ABI-compatible
versions have been a source of trouble, and it creates far too much
complexity with little to no benefit, coupled with absurd and unusable FFmpeg
API artifacts.

Instead, mpv will exit with an error when such a situation is detected.
This simply means that mpv needs to be rebuilt whenever FFmpeg libraries change.

Release 0.13.0
==============

NOTE: The previous release changed the default format for youtube-dl and
removed some workarounds related to MPEG DASH support. However, the required
changes to FFmpeg code (FFmpeg commit 4ab56667594842283dc5ae07f0daba2a2cb4d3af)
are not in any FFmpeg release yet (as of 2015-11-10), so for now, playing DASH
streams requires using FFmpeg git master. You can work around this by using the
--ytdl-format=best option.

https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/compare/v0.9.2...v0.10.0.


Release 0.9.2
=============

Changes
-------

- The Lua check now also checks for `lua52.pc`, as used by Arch Linux testing.
- (X11) `vo_opengl`'s `icc-profile-auto` now queries the current ICC profile
  relative to the center of the window.
- `ao_coreaudio`, `ao_alsa` now support adding dummy padding channels for
  better compatibility with hardware decoders that only support specific
  channel counts (e.g. 5.1 now should work on a decoder that only accepts 7.1).
- Channel fallback (in case the audio device doesn't natively support a given
  channel layout) has been improved.
- `vf_vapoursynth` now rejects unaligned video instead of outputting corrupted
  video.
- mpv now tries to autoload `.sup` subtitles as well.

Bug fixes
---------

- `vo_opengl`'s default for `fbo-format` is now `rgba16`, to avoid rounding
  errors when using non-default `cscale` (issue #1918).
- Improved framedrop behavior when playing video that has higher framerate
  than the display (issue #1897).
- Trying to play a directory will no longer spam `Connection lost!` to the
  console log.
- (Linux) Several `vo_rpi` bugfixes.
- (Linux) Several `vo_drm` bugfixes. Pan&Scan is now supported.
- (X11) Fix fullscreen behavior on certain window managers (issues #1937,
  #1920).
- (OSX) The OSD no longer always shows up on startup.
- (OSX) Several `ao_coreaudio` and `ao_coreaudio_exclusive` bugfixes.
- (OSX) Fixed potential crash on exit when using Cocoa.
- (ClientAPI) `vo_opengl_cb` now actually applies options changed at runtime.
- (OSX, ClientAPI) Cocoa now works when both the `cplayer` (`mpv`) and `libmpv`
  are built at the same time; however, `libmpv` now always creates an
  application singleton. Cocoa has to be disabled completely to prevent
  `libmpv` from creating the singleton.

`git log v0.9.1..v0.9.2` in the git repository or by visiting
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2.

Release 0.9.1
=============

Changes
-------

- mpv's IRC channel moved from #mpv-player to #mpv on chat.freenode.net.
- Documentation updates.
- The default value for the `--ytdl-format` option is now `best`, in order to
  work around `youtube-dl`'s 2015.04.26 release enabling DASH by default, as
  FFmpeg / Libav do not yet properly support DASH.
- When seeking, the current timestamp will show the predicted seek timestamp
  instead, until the final timestamp is resolved. Improves UI responsiveness
  on slow streams and/or large seeks.

Bug fixes
---------

- Corrected the release marker on DOCS/client-api-changes. The release manager
  forgot to fix it before release...
- Fix `vo_vdpau` rendering garbage lines on H.264 video with non-mod16 size
  (issue #1863).
- Fix a crash on exit if the "sub_reload" command had run successfully.
- Fixed seeking with the mouse when `osc-seekbarstyle=bar` is set (issue
  #1876).
- (IPC) Fixed encoding of UTF-8 data in JSON (issue #1874).

`git log v0.9.0..v0.9.1` in the git repository or by visiting
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1.

Release 0.9.0
=============

Changes
-------

Changes that may break users' config files have been annotated with a `(!)`.

- Note: mpv is not compatible with Lua 5.3. Lua 5.1 or 5.2 is required.
- The minimum required libass version is now 0.12.1 or newer.
- The minimum required FFmpeg version is now 2.4.0 (equiv. Libav 11) or newer.
- The internal libmpg123 support was removed. This was already not used by
  default in the previous release.
- `(!)` The LIRC support was removed. Configure LIRC remotes as input devices
  instead.
- `(!)` The Linux Joystick support was removed.
- `(!)` `vf_screenshot` was removed, as they are now handled at a VO level and
  is compatible with all VOs.
- `(!)` `--ass-use-margins` has been renamed to `--sub-use-margins` and applies
  only to plain-text (non-ASS) subtitles (enabled by default). The new
  `--ass-force-margins` option applies only to ASS subtitles (disabled by
  default). To get the old behaviour back, enable both at the same time.
- `(!)` The `--sub-scale-with-window` option now only applies to plain text
  (non-ASS) subtitles (enabled by default). The new `--ass-scale-with-window`
  option does the same but only with ASS subtitles (disabled by default).
- `(!)` The range for the `param1` for the `gaussian` `vo_opengl` scaler has
  been redefined. Instead of being an arbitrary 1-100 range, have a default
  value of 1.0, and anything higher is blurrier.
- `(!)` The `seek`, `playlist_next, `playlist_prev`, `loadfile` and `loadlist`
  parameters no longer accept numerical parameters where symbolic parameter
  names exist.
- `(!)` `vo_opengl` changes:
  - `(!)` The `smoothmotion` suboption has been renamed to `interpolation`.
    The old name is still supported for now.
  - `(!)` The `bilinear_slow` scaler has been renamed to `triangle`.
  - `(!)` `scale-down` has been renamed to `dscale` and now has its own set of
    config options (e.g. `dscale-radius`).
  - `(!)` Scaler radius no longer defaults to `3` but to a preferred value
    that may be different for each filter.
  - The `scale-radius` option may now go down as low as `0.5`, which is the
    value used by the `nearest` filter.
  - `spline36` is the new `cscale` default for `opengl-hq`. This might break
    setups that use `fbo-format=rgb8`. To work around it, leave `fbo-format`
    as its default, or set to something higher than 8, or set `cscale=bilinear`,
    the previous default.
- `(!)` `vf_format` no longer converts video to YUYV if there is no parameter.
  Video is now passed unchanged unless a format is specifically requested.
- `(!)` The `--colormatrix`, `--colormatrix-input-range`,
  `--colormatrix-output-range` and `--colormatrix-primaries` options have been
  converted into `vf_format` suboptions. See commit 27715b7 and the manual for
  details.
- `vf_mirror`'s implementation was replaced with calling into `libavfilter`'s
  `vf_hflip` filter, thus depending on `libavfilter` to function.
- The `device` subption to `ao_wasapi` has been deprecated in favor of
  `--audio-device`.
- `--video-rotate` now allows 360 as an argument instead of stopping at 359.
- Several improvements to `af_scaletempo`.
- Options that have multiple options and also include a "yes" option now
  default to that if specified with no arguments.
- The default value of `--cache-default` is now 150000 (153.6 MB, ~146 MiB).
- JPEG screenshots now use the same subsampling as the source video. The images
  are still RGB regardless of source format though.

Bug fixes
---------

- mpv no longer saves position on files that can't be resumed (issue #1701).
- (X11) Fix the player thinking the mouse has left the window in some WMs /
  embeddings (issue #1672).
- mpv no longer freezes on wayland when the compositor stops asking it to draw
  itself (e.g. when minimized) (issue #249).
- `.ac3` files are no longer rejected by `--audio-file-auto` (issue #1759).
- `ao_wasapi` now automatically enables `exclusive` when passthrough is
  attempted (issue #1742).
- Attempt to fix flickering on Intel VAAPI drivers with `--hwdec=vaapi` and
  `--vo=opengl` (issue #1765).
- `youtube-dl` will no longer download video streams when video playback
  is disabled with `--no-video`.
- (Windows) mpv now prevents system sleep when playing a video-only file.
  Previously, only files with an opened audio track would prevent sleep.

New features
------------

- `vo_opengl` features:
  - Added `ewa_ginseng`, `ewa_hanning`, `robidoux`, `robidouxsharp`,
    `oversample` and `haasnsoft` scalers.
  - There are now `ewa_lanczossoft` and `ewa_lanczossharp` aliases to
    `ewa_lanczos` that are tuned to be blurrier and sharper, respectively.
  - Added `gamma-auto` option that uses ambient light sensors to automatically
    adjust the video gamma. See commit c028d78 for details.
  - Added `blend-subtitles` option to draw subtitles directly into the video
    instead of rendered afterwards. Potentially necessary for correct rendering
    with files that use ASS subtitles for typesetting in combination with an
    `icc-profile`. There is a default option for drawing after upscaling,
    and a `video` option for drawing before upscaling. See details and warning
    on the manual.
  - There is now a `tscale` option, used to choose the temporal scaler used
    in the `interpolation` mode (previously `smoothmotion`).
  - There is a new `scale-blur` parameter to adjust the amount of blur that
    most of the filters produce. Deviating from the default may introduce
    artifacts in EWA filters.
  - (Windows) There is now a `dwmflush` option that might help improve
    rendering of high-fps video. Disabled by default. See manual for options.
- New Linux-only `vo_drm` video output driver. Uses the direct rendering /
  kernel modesetting drivers to draw directly to the framebuffer, but with
  no hardware acceleration. See manual for details.
- New `pseudo-gui` builtin profile, automatically used when launched from
  `mpv.desktop` by opening `mpv.exe` on windows (`mpv.com` still works as
  usual), or by opening the `mpv.app` bundle. The `pseudo-gui` tries to make
  the player window behave closer to what a desktop player would do, by not
  immediately closing and allowing the user to drag&drop files for playback.
  See manual for details.
- mpv can now play directories by automatically playing their contents instead.
  Works everywhere but on Windows, due to issues with Windows' C runtime.
- Add support to pitch correct stretched audio with librubberband.
- Add support for the Raspberry Pi 2's hardware decoder when FFmpeg (or Libav)
  is built with `--enable-mmal`. See commit 8fff125 for details.
- The `--cache` option now accepts a "yes" option, that always enables a
  `--cache-default`-sized cache on all cases a cache can be used, unless
  `--cache-default` disables caching.
- `ao_pulse`, `ao_coreaudio` and `ao_wasapi` now support device hotplugging.
- New `--osd-align-x` and `--osd-align-y` options can be used to align the OSD
  independently from subtitles.
- New `--osd-bold` and `--sub-text-bold` options can be enabled to bold all
  OSD or plain-text subtitle text, respectively.
- Added a default keybind to the `u` key that enables/disables ASS style
  overriding. When enabled, is equivalent to `--ass-style-override=force`.
- There is now a `MOUSE_ENTER` keybind, that is called when the mouse cursor
  enters the VO from outside.
- The new `--ytdl-params` option can be set to arguments that are always given
  to `youtube-dl` invocations. There is no sanity checking, so invalid options
  can prevent `mpv` from working with http URLs.
- There's a new `--demuxer-mkv-fix-timestamps` option, enabled by default, that
  tries to guess more accurate video timestamps by using FPS information, if
  available. See manual for details.
- The new `--window-scale` option can be used to scale the video window by the
  specified multiplier, before other options such as `--autofit` are applied.
- `vo_direct3d_shaders` now supports NV12 colorspace without using stretchrect,
  but it seems no drivers actually support that.
- (Client API) Added a `rescan_external_files` command, as requested on issue
  #1586.
- (Client API) If enabled, initializing the Client API will now also load the
  user's `mpv.conf`.
- (Client API) There's a new `mpv_opengl_cb_report_flip()` call for API users
  to call to inform mpv of when exactly a frame was displayed.
- (Client API) The `mpv_opengl_cb_render()` function was deprecated in favor
  of the new, simpler `mpv_opengl_cb_draw()` function.
- (Client API) There is a new `screenshot_raw` command. See `input.rst` for
  details.
- The `--input-file` argument may now also be a file descriptor in the form
  "fd://N", where N is the FD number.

`git log v0.8.0..v0.8.1` in the git repository or by visiting
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1.

Release 0.8.0
=============

Changes
-------

Changes that may break users' config files have been annotated with a `(!)`.

- `(!)` vo_opengl_old has been removed. OpenGL rendering now requires hardware
  that can do at least OpenGL 2.1, the oldest version supported by vo_opengl.
- `(!)` vf_pp has been removed. A version of it can still be accessed through
  lavfilter (e.g. --vf=lavfi=[pp...]), but it receives no QP information.
  Also, vf_dlopen no longer passes QP information to its loaded plugin either
  (it's always 0).
- `(!)` vf_softpulldown, vf_swapuv, vf_phase, vf_divtc and vf_ilpack have all
  been removed. Ports or alternative versions of these filters are available
  through libavfilter (vf_lavfi).
- vf_pullup and vf_noise now are simply wrappers to their libavfilter
  equivalents. Both are only currently available on FFmpeg (not Libav).
- `(!)` ao_portaudio has been removed. There is good support for the native
  audio drivers of all major desktop platforms, as well as ao_sdl and
  ao_openal as fallbacks.
- `(!)` vo_opengl's `lscale` suboption has been renamed to `scale`; `lradius`
  is now `scale-radius`, `lparam1` and `lparam2` are now respectively
  `scale-param1` and `scale-param2`; `lscale-down` is now `scale-down`.
  The `cscale` suboption remains as is.
- `(!)` Several of the `vo_opengl` radius-preset aliases supported by `scale`
  have been removed; use `scale-radius` to set if needed. For example, use
  `--vo=opengl:scale=lanczos:scale-radius=2` instead of `scale=lanczos2`.
  The default radius is recommended for most filters.
- `(!)` vo_opengl no longer supports the `stereo` suboption. The anaglyph
  effect can be reproduced with the stereo3d filter. The quadbuffer support,
  which requires expensive specialized hardware to begin with, is removed.
- `(!)` The `approx-gamma` suboption to vo_opengl has been removed. The
  BT.1886 specification says that it's actually how it's supposed to be done
  so it is now the default when `srgb` or `icc-profile` are enabled. This does
  not include BT.1886's gamma drop.
- `(!)` The `no-scale-sep` and `indirect` suboptions to vo_opengl have been
  removed. These are now autodetected and enabled whenever they would have
  benefit.
- `(!)` The `--lua` and `--lua-opts` parameters / options are now called
  `--script` and `--script-opts`, respectively. The `lua` subdir of the mpv
  config dir is also now expected to be called `scripts` instead.
- `(!)` The `--fixed-vo` option has been removed. It has been the default for
  a long time anyway, and disabling fixed-vo is not useful.
- vo_opengl_hq has been updated to take into account new features.
  `fancy-downscaling` and `sigmoid-upscaling` are enabled,
  "mitchell" is now the default for `scale-down`.
- The `sub-visibility` OSD message is now clearer about whether subtitles
  are hidden or just not available / selected.
- The device IDs given to `--audio-device` for use with ao_coreaudio now use
  UIDs, so they don't change when devices are added/removed or after reboots.
- `--msg-level` now also accepts ',' as separator.
- (Client API) The client API now refuses to initialize if the LC_NUMERIC
  locale is not "C".
- (Client API) The native type of the `msg-level` parameter is now a key-value
  list. Setting or reading it as a string still works.
- (Slave API) The `get_property` command is now deprecated.
- Documentation updates.
- PDF documentation is now disabled by default due to rst2pdf being fickle,
  causing weird build errors.
- Print desync messages with negative A/V sync as well. While rare, it could
  happen with some uses of `--autosync`.

Bug fixes
---------

- (Windows) Avoid resizing the video window when player is minimized, might
  address bug #1547.
- (NetBSD) Fix build with v4l2.
- (Linux) Attempt to address conflicts with the pulseaudio mixer. (bug #1578)
- Multiple cdda:// fixes. (bugs #1555, #1560)
- VP9 timestamps no longer cause "missing PTS" warnings with new enough FFmpeg
  builds.
- Fix a crash when using H.264 hardware decoding on new enough libavcodecs.
  (bug #1587)

New features
------------

- vo_opengl now supports frame blending to eliminate stuttering when the video
  framerate does not nicely match the display framerate through the
  `smoothmotion` suboption. This is not meant to artificially increase the
  video's FPS, so there is no "soap opera effect" or difficulties with some
  video types (e.g. anime).
- vo_opengl now supports sigmoidal upscaling (e.g. for fullscreen), which
  reduces ringing induced by upscaling, enabled through the
  `sigmoid-upscaling` suboption.
- vo_opengl now supports ewa_lanczos (Jinc) scaling, which provides higher
  quality with less aliasing. It supports an experimental `scale-antiringing`
  parameter, which tries to further reduce video ringing.
- vo_opengl now has a `linear-scaling` suboption, that makes the scalers work
  in linear light. Implied by the `srgb`, `icc-profile` or the new
  `sigmoid-upscaling` suboption.
- vo_opengl has improved downscaling for higher downscale ratios when
  `fancy-downscaling` is enabled.
- Add `--keep-open=always` to make `--keep-open` apply to all files instead of
  only the last.
- mpv now filters the tags that are printed on the console to try to hide
  useless metadata. The filter works as a whitelist, and can be configured
  with the `--display-tags` option.
- Add a `--sub-scale-by-window` option that, when set to 'no', prevents
  subtitles from changing their pixel size when the window changes sizes.
- vo_opengl now technically has GLES 2 and 3 support (but not GLES 1). GLES 3
  support is only tested on Mesa's software emulation. GLES 2 has been tested
  on nvidia drivers. Both GLES modes are feature deficient and inefficient due
  to GLES limitations, so they should not be preferred over the standard
  OpenGL mode.
- (X11) vo_opengl now supports the `icc-profile-auto` option on X11 hosts.
- The 'A' key now by default cycles through a list of preset aspect ratios.
  Meant to be used to work around broken files.
- There is now a "force" mode for `--loop`. Works like "inf", but tries to
  open files/streams even if there was an error on the previous attempt.
- There is now a `--log-file` option to write mpv's log messages to a specifed
  file.
- There is now a `--audio-file-auto` option to automatically load an external
  audio file with certain constraints. Will only load external audio if the
  playing file has a video stream. Set to "exact" by default. (bug #967)
- There is now a `--network-timeout` option to specify a timeout in seconds
  for network access. If 0 (default), uses the libavformat default. If a
  protocol that doesn't support timeouts is used, this option is ignored.
- (X11) The XF86 special keys are now all mappable in `input.conf`. All keys
  documented in `XF86keysym.h` are available, but only as their numeric codes.
- (Linux) The DVB implementation now supports DVB-S2 through S2API.
- (Linux) The VDR format for `channels.conf` is now supported and preferred.
  See http://linuxtv.org/vdrwiki/index.php/Syntax_of_channels.conf for the
  syntax. Tuning to DVB-S2 channels requires the VDR-format `channels.conf`.
- (Linux) There is now a `--dvbin-full-transponder` option for handling
  special broadcast cases where PIDs switch, or just to work around incomplete
  PID data.
- (Client API) There is now an opengl_cb VO, which receives the OpenGL context
  from the libmpv client. This allows a client to render libmpv video directly
  to a provided OpenGL context without having to use --wid embedding.
- (Client API) The aforementioned --wid parameter can now be set at any time,
  but has no effect if a file is already loaded.
- (Client API) The list of DVD titles can now be queried.
- (Client API) There is now a `filtered-metadata` property, containing only
  the tags allowed by `--display-tags`.
- (Client API) There is now support for XEmbed `--wid` targets, such as a
  `GtkSocket`'s `gtk_socket_get_id()`.
- (Client API) There is now a `file-format` property with a symbolic name
  for the file format. In some cases this might be a comma separated list
  of various different extensions due to libavformat idiosyncrasies.
- (Client API) There is now a `mouse` command for generating mouse events
  over the video window.
- (Client API) There is now a `partially-seekable` property that indicates
  whether a file is only considered `seekable` because of the stream cache,
  but would not be seekable otherwise (e.g. realtime stream, or HTTP with
  no resume support). Small relative seeks may be fine, but larger seeks
  will likely fail.
- (Client API) There is now an MPV_EVENT_QUEUE_OVERFLOW event that is posted
  whenever events have to be dropped because the queue is full. No further
  events are posted until the MPV_EVENT_QUEUE_OVERFLOW is consumed to avoid
  duplicated posting.
- (Client API) There is now a helper `mpv_wait_async_requests()` function
  that blocks until all known async requests have completed. (bug #1542)
- (Client API) There is now a `detected-hwdec` property that returns the
  detected hardware decoder when one is successfully opened. This probably
  only returns a valid value after playback has started.
- (Client API) There are now `audio_add`, `audio_remove` and `audio_reload`
  counterparts to the equivalent `sub_` commands for handling external audio
  files.

Release 0.7.3
=============

Changes
-------

- Several documentation updates and typo fixes.
- Don't show "0%" position when the stream is infinite / has unknown length.
- Fixes the config file loading order so that lower priority `mpv.conf` files
  don't override higher priority `config` files.
- (OSX) Remove coreaudio_exclusive from the "auto" codec list.
- Failing to create a GL3 context is now a warning instead of error, to reduce
  user confusion.
- The subtitle decoder now gets reset when cycling subtitles. This makes the
  currently shown subtitle event disappear even if cycling back to the current
  subtitle track.
- `--shuffle` and `--merge-files` now affects the contents of playlist files,
  instead of just the list of files given as arguments to mpv.
- `./waf install` avoids installing a few additional data/config files if only
  libmpv was built.
- Improved channel mapping when the file's channel map doesn't match the AO's
  available channel maps.
- (OSX) VDA now gracefully refuses to run on non-OpenGL3-capable systems instead
  of trying and failing to build its shaders.
- Add workaround for vf_vapoursynth filters that expect an FPS.
- The default value for `--screenshot-template` now shows up in
  `--list-options`.
- `ao_pulse`'s `latency-hacks` suboption is now off by default, as it causes
  issues with newer pulseaudio releases. If A/V Sync issues happen, either
  add the `latency-hacks=on` pulse suboption in mpv.conf, or update the
  pulseaudio daemon (bug #1430).
- (Linux) `ao_alsa` now deals better with audio device disconnection.
- Client API: timestamp properties that have no value return "no" instead of
  magic number.

Bug fixes
---------

- (Windows, OSX) Many `ao_wasapi` and `ao_coreaudio` fixes.
- (OSX) Make the window title update correctly on OS X Yosemite.
- Fixes for handling mono audio on various AOs.
- (Linux) Fixes resuming from suspend on ao_alsa.
- Fixes for playlist file parsing.
- Overly long options in the --list-options output now break the column layout
  instead of getting truncated; fixes shell completion scripts.
- Fix rendering resolution of certain DVB subtitles (bug #1425).
- Fix EDL or --merge-files breaking timestamps with .avi files.
- Workaround for libavcodec bug with the VP9 codec parser (bug #1448),
  fixes possible crash.
- Improve robustness of the matroska parser with broken files (bugs #1457,
  #1461).
- Improve 10bit video compatibility with older GPUs (specially Intel) (bug
  #1383).
- Fixes flashing the VO window when playing a list of files that includes
  non-media files (bug #1459).
- Workaround for window embedding in OpenBox (bug #1235)
- Fixes for several crashes and lockups (bugs #838, #1389, #1408, #1463, #1473,
  #1474).
- Fixes for the zsh completion script (bugs #997)

New features
------------

- mpv now prints the contents of its config.h when running in verbose mode, to
  aid with debugging.
- The `include=` option now accepts `~` to refer to the HOME dir (bug #1406).
- `af_volume` now prints ReplayGain values in verbose mode.
- m3u playlists that don't have the `#EXTM3U` header are now accepted if they
  "look like" ASCII or UTF-8 text and have the .m3u extension.
- Chapter marks in the seek bar now update when switching files.
- Supports embedded cover art in MKV files (bug #1374).
- (Windows) Video window can now be resized even with --no-border.
- (Windows) Client API: the "run" command now works on Windows too.
- (Linux) vo_wayland now supports key modifiers (Meta, Alt, Control, Shift)
- Client API: "display-names" property is now observable.

Release 0.7.2
=============

Changes
-------

- Give precedence to the DVD menu navigation keyboard bindings so that user
  defined LEFT/RIGHT/... bindings don't break DVD menu navigation.
- Try to fallback to the "default" device if the selected device is busy in the
  alsa AO.
- Don't create Dock icon for audio only files on OS X.
- Save screenshots to desktop when using the app bundle on OS X.
- Restore ab-loop settings with playback resume.
- Bump required youtube-dl version to 2014.11.26 and enable the ytdl_hook Lua
  script by default (now playing videos from YouTube and the like will work
  out of the box without any configuration change needed).

Bug fixes
---------

- Don't signal an error if --stream-dump is used.
- Fix removing key bindings from Lua scripts.
- Reject channel descriptions with too many channels in the coreaudio AO.
- Don't async redraw when waiting for VO redraw on OS X (this fixes the very
  annoying glitch where the black bars disappear for a single frame when going
  fullscreen).
- Fix mono playback with the also AO.
- Don't crash if framebuffers are not available in the opengl VO.

New features
------------

- Try to handle multi-arc videos in the ytdl_hook Lua script.

Release 0.7.1
=============

Changes
-------

- Don't show the volume neutral marker on the OSD if softvol is disabled.
- Don't select a subtitle track when executing the sub_add input command in
  "auto" mode.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix busy loop when seeking while paused (this fixes a problem with pulseaudio
  that caused mpv and the pulseaudio daemon to use 100% CPU).
- Fix Lua function utils.subprocess() in Windows versions older than Vista.
- Avoid creating a window bigger than the screen on Windows.
- Don't ignore the last line in m3u playlists.
- Don't crash if a codec could not be opened.
- Dynamically allocate audio channel map entries (this should fix a crash in
  the alsa and coreaudio AOs with audio devices that support more than 20
  channel maps).
- Ignore the "srgb" option in the opengl VO if hardware decoding is enabled.
- Linearize non-RGB sRGB files correctly (eg. JPEG).
- Fix opening reference URLs (.file/id=) on OS X.

the git repository or by visiting
https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/compare/8d8b36d...6583ad6.

Release 0.7.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Buffer partial log messages in the client API (the client API will now only
  pass full log messages to clients).
- Remove ncurses/terminfo/termcap support (it was disabled by default and
  replaced by new code since v0.6.0).
- Enable cdda:// support by default again (it was disabled since v0.6.0).
- Cascade-load input.conf (if there are several input.confs in the set of valid
  config paths, load them all).
- Draw the OSD twice in 3D mode (this fixes subtitles display in 3D mode).
- Make wasapi the default AO on Windows again since many of its problems have
  been solved.
- Use "site-functions" subdir to install the zsh completion script instead of
  the Debian-specific "vendor-completions" (also provide the --zshdir waf
  configure option for changing this value).
- Improve synchronization between the Cocoa GUI and the player (this fixes some
  long standing deadlock issues on Mac OS X).
- Remove --fs-missioncontrol option (only relevant to Mac OS X).

New features
------------

- Enable pitch correction by default when playing at higher speeds (this can be
  controlled with the --audio-pitch-correction option).
- Open stream and demuxer asynchronously (this should avoid having the player
  get blocked on network streams).
- Add cache-buffering-state property for querying the cache fill status until
  the player unpauses.
- Add support for listing and selecting the audio device (note that it is not
  implemented for all AOs, see the --audio-device option for more information).
- Add support for a JSON-based IPC mechanism (note that this is not currently
  supported on Windows, see the JSON IPC section in the manpage for more
  information).
- Add Lua utility function for starting processes (see utils.subprocess() in the
  manpage).
- Add Lua utility function for parsing JSON (see utils.parse_json() in the
  manpage).
- Add field-dominance property (see --field-dominance option).
- Add video-rotate property (see --video-rotate option).
- Add playback-abort property for querying whether playback is stopped or is to
  be stopped.
- Add cursor-autohide property (see --cursor-autohide option).
- Add vo-configured property for querying whether a window is created.
- Add support for dxva2 hardware acceleration on Windows.
- Drop libquvi support (this has been replaced by a built-in Lua script that
  invokes the youtube-dl tool, which needs to be installed, see the --ytdl
  option).
- Add support for loading chapters from an external file (see the
  --chapters-file option).
- Add window-minimized property for querying whether the window is minimized
  (works for X11 only).
- Make it possible to configure the OSC seekbar style (see the "seekbarstyle"
  OSC option).
- Add support for libmpv on Mac OS X (it used to be broken, now it's fully
  functional and also provides support for embedding the mpv window inside a
  Cocoa/Qt application).
- Try to use the audio channel map reported by ALSA in the alsa AO.
- Add option to disable text OSD rendering completely (useful for working around
  certain fontconfig issues, see the --use-text-osd option).
