Release 0.5.1
=============

Changes
-------

- Add audio/flac to the MIME type list in mpv.desktop.
- The --slave-broken option has been reintroduced and is equivalent to using
  --input-file=/dev/stdin and --input-terminal=no.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fix screenshots with anamorphic videos in the vdpau vo.
- Fix a crash happening when mpv fails to create a vdpau mixer in the vdpau vo.
- Don't quit when the --loop-file option is used.
- Always load the cursor theme in the wayland vo (this fixes a crash caused by
  moving the mouse cursor over the video).
- Properly return non-zero from the zsh completion script when no matches are
  found (this fixes the use of user-defined zsh completion matchers).
- Fix the description of the opengl-hq vo default options in the manpage.
- Remove duplicated content from the manpage that was accidentally added in the
  manpage reorganization from the previous release.
- Avoid clobbering playback position on video end (when both audio and video
  streams reached the end, the playback poisition was briefly set at 0).
- Avoid overwriting user input in the coreaudio_device ao.

Release 0.5.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Support setting the start time relative to the start PTS with --start.
- Use /dev/sr0 as default cdrom/dvd device on Linux.
- Change "cache" property representation to float.
- Split the ao_coreaudio audio output into ao_coreaudio (which uses the
  AudioUnits and the CoreAudio sound server) and ao_coreaudio_device (which uses
  direct device access).
- Complete supported URL schemes in the zsh completion script.
- Enable compiler optimizations (-O2) during build.
- Allow precise seeking with percent-based seeks too.
- Do precise seeks when clicking on the OSC seekbar.
- Remove support for older VDA hwaccel versions on Mac OS X (requires recent
  versions of ffmpeg/libav).
- Remove the last remains of slave mode (--slave-broken option). Support for
  reading input commands from stdin can be emulated using: --input-terminal=no
  --input-file=/dev/stdin.
- Some key binding were remapped or removed:
  + "LEFT" and "RIGHT" have been remapped to seek 5 seconds instead of 10.
  + "c" for changing the YUV color space was unmapped.
  + OSD level cycling has been remapped from "o" to "O".
  + "o" is now mapped to the show_progress command (like "P").
  + "PGUP" and "PGDWN" have been remapped to chapter-based seeks (the old
    bindings "@" and "!" are still available). The old behvaiour has been
    remapped to "Shift+PGUP" and "Shift+PGDWM".
  + Increasing/decreasing audio delay have been remapped from "+" and "-" to
    "Ctrl++" and "Ctrl+-".
  + "(" and ")" for adjusting audio balance have been unmapped.
  + "F" for toggling the "sub-forced-only" option has been unmapped.
  + "TAB" for cycling TS programs has been unmapped.
  + "A" for cycling DVD angle has been unmapped.
  + "U" for stopping playback has been unmapped.
  + "l" and "L" for cycling quvi format have been unmapped.
- Make it possible to build the client API (libmpv) on Mac OS X.
- Do necessary checks for nested Wayland compositors which only have limited
  interfaces.
- The options in the manpage have been re-organized into sections and ordered by
  usage to make it easier to navigate.
- The "hard" framedrop mode has been removed (this behaviour is still available
  via the --vd-lavc-framedrop option).
- Show the basename of a subtitle file only (without the directory part).

Bug fixes
---------

- Use a default color space for files with no video (this fixes color managed
  OSD messages when no video channel is present).
- Fix key equivalent dispatching for Cocoa on Mac OS X.
- Disable non-interleaved audio formats by default with ao_alsa, since some
  ALSA plugins don't cope well with them (non-interleaved formats can still be
  enabled using the "non-interleaved" ao_alsa option).
- Fix deadlock in the client API when calling mpv_terminate_destroy() before
  mpv_initialize().
- Fix flushing of filter chain (this fixes a bug where the last frames would get
  dropped on EOF, if buffered by filters).
- Actually use the channels.conf configuration file for DVB.
- Restore the --dvbin-file option.
- Fix off by one error in the command parser which caused a segfault when using
  the mp.commandv() Lua function with 10 or more arguments.

New features
------------

- Search for config files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS in addition
  to ~/.mpv. The config file has also been renamed to mpv.conf (although the
  old file still works and will be loaded even if the new one exists).
- Add "playback-time" property that returns the current playback time always
  starting at 0. This is now used to show the playback time in the OSD and the
  status line, fixing the shown playback time for transport streams that start
  at a completely random timestamp.
- Add cache-related "cache-free", "cache-used" and "cache-idle" properties.
- Add option to list supported protocols (--list-protocols).
- Allow setting libavformat stream options with the --stream-lavf-o option.
- Support running the demuxer in a separate thread and prefetch packets (this
  can be enabled using the --demuxer-thread option).
