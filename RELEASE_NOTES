Release 0.6.2
=============

Changes
-------

- The --ass-style-override option now requires a newer version of libass.

Bug fixes
---------

- Correctly signal EOF when using --frames.
- Strictly endorce the limit imposed by --frames (i.e. avoid producing an extra
  frame at the end).
- Fix \x-style escaping when parsing commands.
- Correctly handle ^h key on the terminal (this should fix the when inserted
  fromBackspace key on new versions of xterm).
- Don't put the player to sleep after audio reinit.
- Properly exit if both audio and video fail to initialize.

Release 0.6.1
=============

Changes
-------

- Don't show message on "osd" command by default (this essentially reverts a
  change introduced in the last release).
- Add an alternative input configuration that reverts the key binding changes
  introduced by previous releases (see etc/restore-old-bindings.conf in the
  sources).
- Automatically install example input configuration files.

Bug fixes
---------

- Make stream language work with Bluray as well (the previous release
  introduced this for DVDs, but it didn't work for Blurays).
- Don't try to create surfaces of size 0 in the VDPAU vo.
- Don't print audio/video init failure message twice.
- Fix playback on the root window on X11 (i.e. when using --wid=0).
- Fix the autodetection of the input format in the vf_stereo3d filter when mpv
  is built against libav (this makes --video-stereo-mode work with libav as
  well).
- Fix compilation with PulseAudio 1.0.
- Fix compilation with clang.
- Try harder to decode cover art picture only once.
- Fix cursor autohide (--cursor-autohide) with audio-only files on file change
  (e.g. when skipping to the next playlist file).

Release 0.6.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Map ESC to exiting fullscreen.
- Run the vo inside its own thread.
- Enable the demuxer thread by default.
- Prefer the opengl vo over the vdpau one.
- Complete profile names in the zsh completion script.
- Raise dsound ao buffer size to 200ms and make it configurable.
- Bind ctrl+c to quit, so that it works both in the terminal and the player
  window.
- Automatically load playlists without needing --load-unsafe-playlists or
  --playlist. Unsafe URLs are still rejected (e.g. remote playlists can't load
  local files).
- Remove quvi-format property (which never really worked).
- Wait until all Lua scripts are loaded on start.
- Use separate threads for input sources (terminal, lirc, joystick) instead of
  using a central I/O loop.
- Complete values for options that take file names in the zsh completion script.
- Use libwaio for pipe input on Windows (if you want --input-file to work on
  Windows you need libwaio as an additional dependency).
- Remove the --volstep option (users should change the argument to the "add"
  function in input.conf instead).
- Always show the OSD message when changing volume, gamma, panscan, etc along
  with the OSD bar.
- When changing a property always show it on the OSD (except for "pause" and
  "fullscreen").
- Prefer the libavcodec decoder over libmpg123 for mp3 decoding (ffmpeg/libav
  support for gapless audio works better for mpv's use-case).
- Allow passing number of loops to --loop-file.
- Change --keep-open option semantics to not terminate the player when playing
  or seeking past the end of the file and there's no next file to be played.
- Disable the sndio ao by default and prefer other outputs even if it's enabled.

New features
------------

- Add new framedrop mode that limits the frequency of new video frames displayed
  based on the display framerate (this is enabled by default, the old
  decoder-based mode can be enabled with --framedrop=decoder).
- Add --demuxer-readahead-secs option to control the readahead buffer using a
  duration value.
- Add estimated-frame-count and estimated-frame-number properties.
- Add --cache-secs option which overrides the value of --demuxer-readahead-secs
  if the stream cache is active.
- Add demuxer-cache-duration and demuxer-cache-idle properties.
- Make --cache-file create a temporary file if the string "TMP" is passed
  instead of a file name.
- Add support for Matroska 3D (if a file is marked as 3D using the StereoMode
  element, an automatic conversion filter is added).
- Add --osd-playing-msg option to show a message on the OSD when the playback
  starts.
- Add --media-title option to force the content of the media-title property.
- Add --osd-msg1, --osd-msg2 and --osd-msg3 options to override the OSD message
  for the corresponding OSD level (before only level 3 could be overridden with
  --osd-status-message).
- Add support for digital passthrough in the pulse ao.
- Add support for opening DVD and Bluray directories directly.
- Add --input-x11-keyboard option to control whether keyboard input should be
  enabled on the X11 window ot not (this is disabled by default when using the
  libmpv library).
