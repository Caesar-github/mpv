Don't ask questions about issues, errors or problems you have and instead open
a proper issue with the right template from the previous selection.

This template is meant for questions about the workings of mpv, to clarify about
unspecified behaviour of options or command, or anything else that is not well
described and needs clarification.

Before asking a question make sure it hasn't been asked or answered yet.
