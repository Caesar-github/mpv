/* Note:
 *
 * In general, there are two types of audio drivers:
 *  a) push based (the user queues data that should be played)
 *  b) pull callback based (the audio API calls a callback to get audio)
 *
 * The ao.c code can handle both. It basically implements two audio paths
 * and provides a uniform API for them. If ao_driver->play is NULL, it assumes
 * that the driver uses a callback based audio API, otherwise push based.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *  a) ->play is called to queue audio. push.c creates a thread to regularly
 *     refill audio device buffers with ->play, but all driver functions are
 *     always called under an exclusive lock.
 *     Mandatory:
 *          init
 *          uninit
 *          reset
 *          get_space
 *          play
 *          get_delay
 *          pause
 *          resume
 *     Optional:
 *          control
 *          drain
 *          wait
 *          wakeup
 *  b) ->play must be NULL. ->resume must be provided, and should make the
 *     audio API start calling the audio callback. Your audio callback should
 *     in turn call ao_read_data() to get audio data. Most functions are
 *     optional and will be emulated if missing (e.g. pausing is emulated as
 *     silence). ->get_delay and ->get_space are never called.
 *     Mandatory:
 *          init
 *          uninit
 *          resume      (starts the audio callback)
 *     Also, the following optional callbacks can be provided:
 *          reset       (stops the audio callback, resume() restarts it)
 *          control
