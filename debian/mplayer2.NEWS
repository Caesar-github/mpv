mpv (0.21.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  As mplayer2 is no longer developed and has been removed from Debian Stretch,
  the mplayer2 package now contains a symbolic link redirecting mplayer to
  mpv - a fork of mplayer2.

  While mpv is similar to mplayer2, a number of options have changed and the
  configuration is now stored in ~/.config/mpv instead of ~/.mplayer.
